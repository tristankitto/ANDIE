__ANDIE__ loads images and edits them with  operations such as colour filters, brightness/contrast adjustment, rotations and reflections etc. These operations are stored in a stack to enable undoing, allowing the changes to be __non-destructive__ ie. reversible. Undone operations are stored on another stack, enabling redo.
